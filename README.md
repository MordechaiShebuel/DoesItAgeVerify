This page is a running list of Open Source Operating Systems and Software (Linux & *BSD distributions, system components, etc.) and what their current status is regarding age verification.

There are several locales which have laws (in various stages) which require Operating Systems and their software components to perform some level of age verification and reporting.

Passed OS-Level Age Verification Laws: [Brazil](https://x.com/lundukejournal/status/2033927808196481101), & [California](https://x.com/lundukejournal/status/2026783141298360692).

Proposed OS-Level Age Verification Laws: [Colorado](https://x.com/lundukejournal/status/2026331487499370988), [Illinois](https://x.com/lundukejournal/status/2031047619225493597), & [New York](https://x.com/lundukejournal/status/2029081398577922173?s=61).

### Operating Systems Not Implementing Age Verification

The developers or publishers of these open source Operating Systems have decided to not implement Age Verification, or are currently restricting access in regions with Age Verification laws.

### Operating Systems Planning to Implement Age Verification

The developers or publishers of these Open Source Operating Systems have made plans and/or statements that they intend to comply with new Age Verification laws.  But, as yet, that Age Verfication functionality is not fully implemented.

### Operating Systems With Ongoing Discussions (No Decision Yet)

The developers or publishers of these Operating Systems have active community or developer discussions about Age Verification laws but have not yet made an official decision.

| &nbsp; | Operating System | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| :speech_balloon: | **Bazzite** | Brazil block was applied by mistake and not intentional; [official clarification on X](https://x.com/bazzite_gg/status/2034286537723007222); no official position on age verification adopted |
| :speech_balloon: | **CachyOS** | Says they won't do anything, but also says they'll block you for asking. [official clarification on X](https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/2037897691787599953); Like any other distro in this list using SystemD, when they say they won't do anything - they automatically inherit whatever XDG and SystemD are doing. |
| :speech_balloon: | **NixOS** | [Community discussion](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/compliance-with-u-s-age-verification-laws/75791) — contributors skeptical NixOS will implement verification independently without a standardized ecosystem-wide approach; no official position adopted |
| :speech_balloon: | **Fedora** | [Community discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/a-practical-architectural-solution-to-os-level-age-verification-laws/183387) — proposal to make networking an optional patch to avoid triggering regulatory requirements; community raises technical concerns; coordinating cross-distro solutions with openSUSE; no official position adopted |
| :speech_balloon: | **Debian** | [debian-legal mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2026/03/msg00022.html) — Adenix GNU/Linux founder (March 4, 2026) states his distros will not implement age checks and requests mechanisms to remove age verification packages and blacklist affected regions (California, Colorado); raises constitutional and free speech concerns; no official Debian project position adopted |
| :speech_balloon: | **EndeavourOS** | [Developer comment](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/03/endeavouros-titan-released-devs-comment-on-age-verification-laws/) — acknowledge complexity, lack resources for independent compliance; called on OSI, FSF, and Linux Foundation to take a stance |
| :speech_balloon: | **OpenMandriva** | No official position adopted yet; project is considering multiple approaches to dealing with what they characterize as "stupid, dumb, and evil" age verification laws; opposed to implementation |

## Other Open Source Software

Age verification is not limited to full Operating Systems. System-level components and desktop infrastructure projects are also beginning to implement or plan support for age verification.

### Software With Ongoing Discussions (No Decision Yet)

| &nbsp; | Software | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| :speech_balloon: | **F-Droid** | No official statement on California AB-1043, Brazil Lei 15.211, or Colorado SB26-051; internal GitLab issues discuss segregating adult content to a separate repository; [forum thread on EU age verification laws](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/european-internet-age-verification-law/33098); legal analysis suggests F-Droid may fall outside scope as a nonprofit FOSS project; broader [legal resilience initiative](https://f-droid.org/2025/08/04/strengthening-f-droids-legal-resilience-introducing-the-research-series.html) underway; notably F-Droid published an [open letter opposing Google's mandatory developer identity verification](https://f-droid.org/en/2026/02/24/open-letter-opposing-developer-verification.html) requirement (effective September 2026) — if Google enforces identity verification for all Android developers, age verification for app distribution may become redundant as developer identity would already be established |

### Software Planning to Implement Age Verification

| :building_construction: | **XDG Desktop Portal** | [Draft PR: Add parental controls to the Accounts portal](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/1922) — proposes an age verification API allowing apps to query age ranges rather than exact birth dates; discussion thread locked by maintainers (March 10, 2026), further comments restricted to collaborators only |
| :building_construction: | **archinstall** | [PR: Add required birth date field to user creation](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/pull/4290) — by the same author as the systemd birthDate PR; stores birth date in a systemd userdb drop-in at `/etc/userdb/<user>.user` during Arch installation; PR open but discussion locked as "too heated"; maintainer (Torxed) awaiting an official organizational stance from Arch Linux before merging |
| :building_construction: | **Pacman** | [Draft MR: Age verification support](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman/-/merge_requests/353) — draft merge request proposing age verification integration into the Arch Linux package manager; currently only updates `doc/PKGBUILD.5.asciidoc` (documentation only); may be a joke or placeholder, but could still be taken as a serious suggestion |
